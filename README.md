# snakeNeuralNetwork

Used this tutorial https://towardsdatascience.com/today-im-going-to-talk-about-a-small-practical-example-of-using-neural-networks-training-one-to-6b2cbd6efdb3 to figure out some of the bases for the Neural Network file, while I completly wrote the Pygame game file on my own.

Had to modify the neural network file quite a bit different from what's shown in the tutorial to fix a lot of bugs, but this was mostly just for learning some base ML and defintely gonna do more projects like this soon.

Modules Used: Numpy, Tflearn, Tensorflow, OS, Math, Pygame, and Random
